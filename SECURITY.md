# 🔐 OpenImpactAI Security Policy

At OpenImpactAI, security and ethical AI development are our priorities.  
This document outlines how to **report security issues** and ensure the responsible use of AI.

## 📌 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a vulnerability or security issue within OpenImpactAI projects:

1. **Do NOT publicly disclose the issue.**
2. **Contact a maintainer privately** via email or an encrypted communication channel.
3. **Provide a detailed report** including:
   - A description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
   - Any potential impacts

We will acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and work towards a resolution.

## 🚀 Ethical AI Development

- **Respect Data Privacy** – Do not use personal or sensitive data in AI models.
