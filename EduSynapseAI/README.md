## 🧠 How It Works

EduSynapseAI operates using **multiple AI agents** that communicate via a shared memory and event system.
Each AI agent is specialized in a **specific area of learning** and **collaborates** with other agents.

### 🔄 AI Agent Workflow Example
1️⃣ **A student struggles with a math problem.**
2️⃣ `math_tutor_agent` detects an issue and sends feedback.
3️⃣ If the problem involves a reading issue, `reading_assistant_agent` provides simplified text.
4️⃣ `motivation_agent` detects low engagement and suggests a motivational message.
5️⃣ `curriculum_designer_agent` updates the student's learning path dynamically.

✅ **The result?** A fully adaptive, AI-powered learning experience.
